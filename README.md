# Competetive Box Collecting Robot
Project Duration: Two(2) months

## University Project
Create a robot that can collect boxes and segregate them by color.


## Rules
1) The robot while active in the arena, must have no human intervention.
Any human intervention will result in deduction of points.

2) A point is awarded when a box is brought back to the home base and correctly segregated by color.
No point is awarded if the box is not segregated correctly.


## Design Choices
The team ultimately decided on the robot design based on 3 factors:
1) Cost of materials 
2) Ease-of-Debugging
3) Object Hit Accuracy

We wanted a low-cost but rigid structure as well as convenience when debugging the circuit and logic for our robot so we decided on using transparent plexiglass on the majority of the build. 

For the robot arm, we decided on a claw shape as it covers more area and is least likely to get stuck when two or more boxes are clumped together. Not only that, when the claw grabs an object and constricts, the target object becomes closer to the color sensor module and accurately detects the color of the box. 

Unrelated note: 
We gave the project the codename "Bakukang" as it has the shape of a stag beetle commonly found in the Philippines.


## What I learned
Our team learned the importance the early stages of the design process.
Most notably, the importance of a CAD (computer-aided-design) and how to use if effectively to smoothen the process creating the hardware. Instead of making the same part over and over again, we could save materials and time by just creating a model inside the CAD and solve design problems virtually.

On the project management point-of-view, I learned how to weigh the priorities of the project.
The robot is by no means perfect.
Given the time constraint, there were a lot of redesigns, lots of wasted materials and source code optimizations.
But our team was able to get the basic functions working correctly and served the purpose of the competition event.
